# Decentralized Global Events Predictor

## Overview

Our project combines cutting-edge technologies to create a decentralized global events predictor. By integrating Iexec for accessing decentralized data, and AI data models like Gemini for processing fetched data, we aim to provide accurate and reliable insights into global events.

## Iexec Integration

Iexec serves as the backbone for accessing decentralized data regarding global events. With its decentralized oracle network, smart contracts can securely interact with real-world data. Integrating iexec's oracle factory into our project involves identifying specific data feeds needed, and feeding it into smart contracts securely.

## AI Data Models

Gemini, our AI data model, processes the fetched data to provide meaningful insights. Integrating Gemini requires setting up infrastructure for deployment and interaction.

## Frontend Development

The frontend is responsible for presenting processed data to users in an accessible manner. This entails designing user interfaces, implementing features for data visualization, and connecting to backend services via APIs. Frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as Next.js are utilized to create an intuitive user experience.

## Integration Testing

Thorough integration testing is paramount to ensure seamless functionality across all project components. This involves testing the interaction between Chainlink, AI data models, the Morph L2 blockchain, and the frontend to identify and resolve any issues or bugs, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our global events predictor.
